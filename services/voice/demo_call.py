"""On-screen 911 conversation for demo recordings. No phone is dialed.

Copied from the recorded call in sentinel_old_demo.mp4, word for word. The opening keeps that call's timing (seconds after the
call connects). Later lines are keyed to the clip second the camera wall is
showing, so each "they have moved" update lands on the camera handoff.
Sentinel's counts and weapons are scene.answer at the second they are said,
the same wording as the recording, so they always match the picture.
